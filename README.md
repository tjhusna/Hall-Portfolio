This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
I am a Naval Officer in the Surface Warfare Community of the US Navy. After graduating from the US Naval Academy in 2014, I served onboard the USS SHILOH (CG 67) out of Yokosuka, Japan, and the USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG 96) out of Norfolk, VA, as the ship's navigator. I currently am an Assistant Professor of Naval Science at Carnegie Mellon University Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit, and am also pursuing a Masters of Public Management at Heinz College.

I was born and raised overseas and have had the privelege of living in Japan, Italy, and Germany. I am a diehard Pittsburgh sports fan and enjoy traveling, cooking, and outdoor activities!

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to gain a better understanding of data interpretation and improve my alaytical data interpretation skills so that I can better interpret Navy-related statistics and metrics and apply them to my future service onboard ships. With the Navy being one of the smallest services (only ~340,000 active members), manpower and staffing onboard afloat commands are enormous concerns. Further developing my data interpretaion skills will allow me to gain more detailed insights from manpower reports and possibly allow me to improve Navy-wide processes in the future.
