# Hall-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
I am a Naval Officer in the Surface Warfare Community of the US Navy. Prior to living in Pittsburgh, I served onboard the USS SHILOH (CG 67) out of Yokosuka, Japan, and the USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG 96) out of Norfolk, VA. I currently am an Assistant Professor of Naval Science at Carnegie Mellon University, and am also pursuing a Masters of Public Management at Heinz College.

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to gain a better understanding of data interpretation and improve my alaytical data interpretation skills so that I can better interpret Navy-related statistics and metrics and apply them to my future service onboard ships.
