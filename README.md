This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
I am a Naval Officer in the Surface Warfare Community of the US Navy. After graduating from the US Naval Academy in 2014, I served onboard the USS SHILOH (CG 67) out of Yokosuka, Japan, and the USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG 96) out of Norfolk, VA, as the ship's navigator. I currently am an Assistant Professor of Naval Science at Carnegie Mellon University Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit, and am also pursuing a Masters of Public Management at Heinz College.

I was born and raised overseas and have had the privelege of living in Japan, Italy, and Germany. I am a diehard Pittsburgh sports fan and enjoy traveling, cooking, and outdoor activities!

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to gain a better understanding of data interpretation and improve my alaytical data interpretation skills so that I can better interpret Navy-related statistics and metrics and apply them to my future service onboard ships. With the Navy being one of the smallest services (only ~340,000 active members), manpower and staffing onboard afloat commands are enormous concerns. Further developing my data interpretaion skills will allow me to gain more detailed insights from manpower reports and possibly allow me to improve Navy-wide processes in the future.

Viz Critique #2

<iframe title="Average Life Expectancy in the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-0wkvH" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0wkvH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="434"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

Overall, the data visualization is not great, not terrible. What immediately stood out to me was that there was no reference scale to verify the disparity in life expectancies. The color scheme, labeling of the bars with pictures, 3D bars, and overall layout were very aesthetically displeasing. The good is that the bars are labeled with values and country, so the eye does not have to go far to interpret the data. I would do a lot differently: I would display the graph as a horizontal mirror bar graph with country names in the middle and male and female life expectancies on different sides. I would also change the color of the male versus female bars and make the graph proportional.

The primary audience is Sky News readers. While I think the graph is effective in getting the point across, I still feel that the visualization could be more useful if displayed proportionately and as a mirror graph.

Again, the graph was effective in communicating it's point: life expectancy of males versus females in United Kingdom countries. However, there is a lot to be gained from displaying the information more proportionately. By changing the color of the male (blue) versus female (red) bars and displaying them in a mirror graph, the reader can better interpret the differences by United Kingdom country.

OIG Vizualization

<iframe title="Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol Apprehensions&amp;nbsp;" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-0zigv" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0zigv/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="228"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

This visualization is intended for readers of the Huffington Post. Readers of this generally prefer to see visualizations that highlight drastic statistics. This visualization provides insight into the increase in apprehensions at a single Border Patrol facility over one year, bringing attention to an increasingly important issue.

<iframe title=" Rio Grande Valley Sector Transport, Escort, Detention and Search (TEDS) Detainee Standards Violations" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-a7IHM" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a7IHM/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="175"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

This visualization for inclusion in the report highlights the high numbers of detainees that are having TEDS standards violated by the apprehending facility. The goal of the visualization is to draw attention to the need for Border Patrol facilities to increase their ability to detain larger quantities of people.
